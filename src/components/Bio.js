          <strong>Hello World!</strong> I am a{" "}
          <strong>Full-Stack Web Developer</strong> from Overland Park Kansas.{" "}
          <strong>Web Development</strong> is something I am{" "}
          <strong>extremely passionate</strong> about and given that{" "}
          <strong>obsession</strong>, most of my free-time is spent on{" "}
          <strong>Stack-Overflow</strong> or <strong>Udemy </strong>
          learning new languages or perfecting the ones I already know. When I
          am not behind the keyboard, I enjoy watching the latest{" "}
          <strong>Anime</strong>, hanging out with my <strong>Wife</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>Daughter</strong>, eating <strong>Taco Bell</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>playing Video Games</strong> - albeit this takes place behind
          the keyboard as well (I am a <strong>PC enthusiast</strong>).

        <p className="about__bio-content">
          My <strong>love for Web Development</strong> began in 2018 when I
          attended a <strong>Full-Stack Web Development BootCamp</strong>{" "}
          through the <strong>University of Kansas</strong>. I have worked in{" "}
          <strong>IT</strong> since 2016 as a support analyst for{" "}
          <strong>AMC Theatres</strong>. As I was considering my{" "}
          <strong>career path</strong> I began looking into different
          specializations because <strong>I knew I wanted to work in IT</strong>
          . After considering several different areas to pursue{" "}
          <strong>I finally found Web Development!</strong> I have always been
          the <strong>creative </strong>type, but{" "}
          <strong>lacked the skill</strong> to compose a perfect painting or
          illustration - but with <strong>Web Development</strong> the only
          thing <strong>holding me back</strong> from designing a website was my
          own ability to <strong>seek the knowledge</strong> to do so. After the
          first few weeks into the <strong>BootCamp</strong>, although
          challenging,{" "}
          <strong>I knew that this was what I wanted to do with my life</strong>
          . I put my aspirations to be a professional
          <strong> Science-Fiction Author</strong> on hold and began to absorb a{" "}
          <strong>wealth of knowledge</strong> that I use daily. I still enjoy{" "}
          <strong>storytelling </strong>
          and do plan to release more novels in the <strong>future</strong>,
          just for fun.
